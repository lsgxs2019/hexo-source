## [Publishing via GitHub](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Publishing_your_website#publishing_via_github)

Now let's examine how to easily publish your site via GitHub Pages.

1. First of all, [sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/) and verify your email address.

2. Next, you need to [create a repository](https://github.com/new) to store files.

3. On this page, in the *Repository name* box, enter *username*.github.io, where *username* is your username. For example, our friend Bob Smith would enter *bobsmith.github.io*. Check the "*Initialize this repository with a README"* box. Then click *Create repository*.

   > **Note:** Make sure your folder has an `index.html` file.
   
5. Navigate your browser to  username .github.io to see your website online. For example, for the username   chrisdavidmills  , go to  *chrisdavidmills*.github.io

   > **Note:** It may take a few minutes for your website to go live. If your website does not display immediately, wait a few minutes. Try again.

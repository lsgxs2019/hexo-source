*  A very useful terminal shortcut

 A very useful terminal shortcut is using the tab key to autocomplete names that you know are present, rather than having to type out the whole thing. For example, after typing the above two commands, try typing `cd D` and pressing tab â€” it should autocomplete the directory name `Desktop` for you, provided it is present in the current directory. 

~~~

cd Desktop/project/src


Note that including a leading slash on your path makes the path absolute, for example /Users/your-user-name/Desktop. Omitting the leading slash like we've done above makes the path relative to your present working directory. This is exactly the same as you would see with URLs in your web browser. A leading slash means "at the root of the web site", whereas omitting the slash means "the URL is relative to my current page".
